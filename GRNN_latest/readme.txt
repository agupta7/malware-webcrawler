my understanding of the problem: 

# fitness : looking for output closer to 0 
# crossover:  for each feature of the 95 feature, at indx  select a random number between the parent1[indx] and parent2[indx] and give it to the child. 
		flat crossover produces one child at a time. 


# Tournament Selection: means that  every time we produce children list of size 20,  and the best  population of both parents and childs is selected to form the next parents list 
# run for 200 candidates: since we have population size of 20, we need to run it 10 time right ???
